Welcome to my project where i did recruitment test.
My tasks were to:

1. Fetch and display table of companies, table should have `id, name, city, total income (sum of company incomes), average income (average of company incomes), last month income (sum of last month incomes) columns. check!

2. You should create your own implementation of table. Bootstrap, antD... it is not allowed. check!

3. Implement sorting, first click on the column header should sort table asceding order by given column,
second click by descending order. check!

4. There should be input that we can filter the result of the table by all fields. check!

5. Table should be paginated. check!

6. App should be responsive (It should work well on both desktop as well as on smaller devices such as mobile phones, tablets).check!

7. Project should contain full documentation (eg. readme). Well.. now also check :)

I hope everything will work like it worked while i was testing it. I will gladly get any feedback even if you think that everything is wrong (but it is not!). I like learning on my mistakes.
